## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (required for ES6 modules)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd multigoal-sip
   ```

2. Start a local web server:

   **Option 1: Using Python**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   **Option 2: Using Node.js (http-server)**
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

   **Option 3: Using PHP**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

   **Option 4: Using VS Code Live Server**
   - Install the "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Why Do I Need a Local Server?

This application uses ES6 modules (`import`/`export`), which require a server due to CORS restrictions. Opening the HTML file directly (`file://`) will not work.

## Usage

1. **Add a Goal**: Fill in the goal details in the form:
   - Goal name (e.g., "Child's Education")
   - Current price in rupees (today's cost)
   - Inflation rate percentage (expected annual inflation)
   - Timeframe in years (when you need the money)
   - Expected annual return percentage (from your investments)

2. **Use Templates** (Optional): Select from 8 pre-configured templates:
   - üéì Child's Higher Education
   - üè† Buy a House
   - üå¥ Retirement Fund
   - üöó Buy a Car
   - üíí Wedding Expenses
   - ‚úàÔ∏è Dream Vacation
   - üíº Start a Business
   - üè• Emergency Fund

3. **Enable Step-up SIP** (Optional): Set annual increment rate (e.g., 10% increase yearly)

4. **How It Works**: The app:
   - Calculates the future value of your goal adjusted for inflation
   - Determines the required monthly SIP (or step-up SIP) to reach that target
   - Shows both current and future costs for transparency
   - Generates interactive charts showing investment growth over time

5. **View Results**: The app displays:
   - **Goal Cards**: Individual goal details with SIP amounts
   - **Interactive Chart**: Visual representation of investment growth
   - **Summary Panel**: 
     - Total monthly SIP needed across all goals
     - Total future value of all investments
     - Total amount you'll invest
     - Total wealth gain (returns earned)

6. **Manage Goals**:
   - **Remove**: Click the √ó button on any goal card
   - **Clear All**: Remove all goals at once (with confirmation)
   - **Export**: Download goals as CSV or JSON
   - **Import**: Upload previously saved goals

7. **Theme Toggle**: Switch between light and dark modes

8. **Automatic Persistence**: Goals and theme preference automatically saved and restored

## Architecture

The application follows SOLID principles with a modular architecture:

**Design Principles**:
- Dependency Injection: Creates and injects all dependencies
- Event coordination: Manages all user interactions
- Minimal logic: Delegates to specialized modules
- Graceful degradation: Works without localStorage
- Single orchestration point: All components initialized here

### SOLID Principles Applied

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each module has one clear responsibility:
- `goal.js` - Data management only
- `calculator.js` - Calculations only
- `formatter.js` - Formatting only
- `ui.js` - UI rendering only
- `app.js` - Coordination only

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
- New goal types can be added by extending `GoalManager`
- New calculation methods can be added to `SIPCalculator`
- New formatters can be added to `Formatter`

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Components accept interfaces that can be substituted
- `UIRenderer` can work with any object implementing calculator/formatter interface

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Each class has focused, minimal interfaces
- No class depends on methods it doesn't use
- Small, cohesive public APIs

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- `app.js` creates and injects dependencies
- `ui.js` receives calculator and formatter via constructor
- Easy to swap implementations for testing

## Development

### Adding New Features

#### Adding a New Calculation
1. Add method to `SIPCalculator` class in `calculator.js`
2. Update UI rendering in `ui.js` if needed
3. No changes needed to other modules

#### Adding a New Display Format
1. Add method to `Formatter` class in `formatter.js`
2. Use new formatter method in `ui.js`
3. No changes needed to calculation logic

#### Adding New Goal Properties
1. Update `GoalManager.addGoal()` signature in `goal.js`
2. Update form in `index.html` to include new input field
3. Update `UIRenderer.getFormValues()` in `ui.js` to capture new field
4. Update card template in `UIRenderer.createGoalCard()` in `ui.js` to display new property
5. Update `app.js` to pass new property when calling `addGoal()`
6. No changes needed to storage - JSON serialization handles new properties automatically

**Example**: The inflation feature was added following these exact steps:
- Added `inflationRate` parameter to `GoalManager.addGoal()`
- Added inflation rate input field to form
- Updated `getFormValues()` to capture inflation rate
- Added `calculateInflationAdjustedAmount()` to calculator
- Updated card display to show both current and future values

#### Adding Persistence to New Features
The storage layer automatically persists any properties added to goals:
- Add new properties to the goal object in `GoalManager.addGoal()`
- Storage service handles serialization/deserialization automatically
- No changes needed to `storage.js` for new goal properties

### Testing Strategy

Each module can be tested independently:

- **`goal.js`**: Test data operations (add, remove, retrieve)
- **`calculator.js`**: Test calculation accuracy with known inputs
- **`formatter.js`**: Test formatting output for various inputs
- **`ui.js`**: Test DOM manipulation (requires jsdom or similar)
- **`app.js`**: Integration tests for complete workflows

### Code Style

The codebase follows these conventions:
- **JSDoc comments** for all classes and methods (Google style)
- **ES6 modules** with explicit imports/exports
- **Descriptive naming** using camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes
- **Pure functions** where possible for predictable behavior
- **Dependency injection** for testability

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Custom styles with smooth transitions
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modules, classes, arrow functions, async/await
- **Tailwind CSS 3.x**: Utility-first CSS framework (CDN) with dark mode support
- **Chart.js 4.4.0**: Interactive chart library (CDN)
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family
- **No Build Tools**: Zero dependencies, runs directly in browser

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 61+ (ES6 modules support)
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 16+

### Browser Storage

- Uses localStorage API for data persistence
- Storage limit: Typically 5-10MB per domain
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Graceful degradation: App works without localStorage (no persistence)
- Clear browser data will remove saved goals

### Performance Considerations

- **Lightweight**: No build process, only 2 CDN dependencies (Tailwind + Chart.js)
- **Fast rendering**: Efficient DOM manipulation with minimal reflows
- **Smart recalculations**: Only updates when data changes
- **Automatic persistence**: Goals saved immediately on add/remove
- **No network requests**: All data stored locally
- **Chart optimization**: Binary search algorithm for step-up SIP calculations
- **Memory management**: Proper chart cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Code splitting**: ES6 modules loaded on-demand by browser
